Version 0.7.0
  Date: 20.09.2022
  Features:
	* Implemented readout of QCA chip and SLAC configurations using QCA function tab ( previously PIB functions tab )

Version 0.6.0
  Date: 08.08.2022
  Features:
	* Added CME ID in HW configuration frame

Version 0.5.0
  Date: 10.6.2022

Version 0.4.0
  Date: 13.05.2022
  Features:
	* Item list of combo boxes changed to read-only
	* In addition to PCAN tool, CMX tool supports Vector CAN tool as well
	* Added EVSE ID in HW Configuration frame for CME
	* Added SLAC_ATTEN_RX_CORRECTION parameter in HW Configuration frame (CME only)
	* Customer can adjust the voltage threshold values for the CP states (CME only)
	* Reading existing voltage threshold values (CME only)
	* CP calibration feature added thus CME module can be calibrated to the actual CP voltage output (CME only)
	* Filters implemented to filter-out packets from PCAP dump. Filters could be set/read 
	* statistical data about PCAP filtration process will be printed after the PCAP file has been successfully read 


Version 0.3.1
  Date: 15.02.2022
  Summary: Combined UDS tool for CME and CMS

  Features:
	* Updated all tabs with pack alignment


Version: 0.1.0
